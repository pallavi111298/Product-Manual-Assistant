Label
The label on the router shows the login information, MAC address, and serial number.
Figure 5. Router label
Types of Logins
Separate types of logins serve different purposes. It is important that you understand the
difference so that you know which login to use when.
Types of logins:
• ISP login. The login that your ISP gave you logs you in to your Internet service. Your
service provider gave you this login information in a letter or some other way. If you
cannot find this login information, contact your service provider.
• WiFi network key or password. Your router is preset with a unique wireless network
name (SSID) and password for wireless access. This information is on the router label.
• Router login. This logs you in to the router interface as admin from an Internet browser.
Use an Internet Browser to Access the Router
When you connect to the network (either with WiFi or with an Ethernet cable), you can use an
Internet browser to access the router to view or change its settings. The first time you access
the router, NETGEAR genie automatically checks to see if your router can connect to your
Internet service.
NETGEAR genie Automatic Internet Setup
You can set up your router with the NETGEAR genie automatically, or you can use the genie
menus and pages to set up your router manually. Before you start the setup process, get your
ISP information and make sure that the computers and devices in the network use the
settings described here.
Connect to the Network and Access the Router
16

--- Page 17 ---
AC 1750Smar tWiFi Router
When your Internet service starts, your Internet service provider (ISP) typically gives you all
the information needed to connect to the Internet. For DSL service, you might need the
following information to set up your router:
• The ISP configuration information for your DSL account
• ISP login name and password
• Fixed or static IP address settings (special deployment by ISP; this setting is rare)
If you cannot locate this information, ask your ISP to provide it. When your Internet
connection is working, you no longer need to launch the ISP login program on your computer
to access the Internet. When you start an Internet application, your router automatically logs
you in.
NETGEAR genie runs on any device with a web browser. Installation and basic setup takes
a bout 15 minutes to complete.
 To use NETGEAR genie to set up your router:
1. Turn the router on by pressing the On/Off button.
2. Make sure that your computer or wireless device is connected to the router with an Ethernet
cable (wired) or wirelessly with the preset security settings listed on the label.
Note: If you want to change the router’s WiFi settings, use a wired connection
to avoid being disconnected when the new WiFi settings take effect.
3. Launch an Internet browser.
The page that displays depends on whether you accessed the router before or if
NETGEAR genie detects that the router is connected to another router or gateway:
• The first time that you set up the Internet connection for your router, the browser goes
to http://www.routerlogin.net, and the NETGEAR genie page displays.
Connect to the Network and Access the Router
17

Set Up an IPv6 6rd Tunnel Internet Connection
6rd protocol makes it possible to deploy IPv6 to sites using a service provider's IPv4 network.
6rd uses the service provider’s own IPv6 address prefix. This limits the operational domain of
6rd to the service provider’s network and is under direct control of the service provider. The
IPv6 service provided is equivalent to native IPv6.
The 6rd mechanism relies upon an algorithmic mapping between the IPv6 and IPv4
addresses that are assigned for use within the service provider’s network. This mapping
allows for automatic determination of IPv4 tunnel endpoints from IPv6 prefixes, allowing
stateless operation of 6rd.
With a 6rd tunnel configuration, the router follows the RFC5969 standard, supporting two
ways to establish a 6rd tunnel IPv6 WAN connection:
• Auto Mode. In IPv6 Auto Detect mode, when the router receives option 212 from the
DHCPv4 option, auto detect selects the IPv6 as 6rd Tunnel setting. The router uses the
6rd option information to establish the 6rd connection.
• Manual Mode. Select 6rd tunnel. If the router receives option 212, the fields are
automatically completed. Otherwise, you must enter the 6rd settings.
 To set up an IPv6 6rd tunnel Internet connection:
1. Launch a web browser from a computer or wireless device that is connected to the
network.
2. Type http://www.routerlogin.net or http://www.routerlogin.com.

the IPv4 network returns 6rd parameters to the router, the page adjusts to display the
correct settings in this section.
• Router’s IPv6 Address on LAN. This field shows the IPv6 address that is acquired
for the router’s LAN interface. The number after the slash (/) is the length of the prefix,
which is also indicated by the underline (_) under the IPv6 address. If no address is
acquired, the field displays Not Available.

Change the MTU Size
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest data packet a network device transmits.
When one network device communicates across the Internet with another, the data packets
travel through many devices along the way. If a device in the data path uses a lower MTU
setting than the other devices, the data packets must be split or “fragmented” to
accommodate the device with the smallest MTU.

The best MTU setting for NETGEAR equipment is often the default value. In some situations,
changing the value fixes one problem but causes another. Leave the MTU unchanged unless
one of these situations occurs:
• You experience problems connecting to your ISP or other Internet service, and the
technical support of either the ISP or NETGEAR recommends changing the MTU setting.
These web-based applications might require an MTU change:
- A secure website that does not open or displays only part of a web page
- Yahoo email
- MSN portal
- America Online’s DSL service
• You use VPN and experience severe performance problems.
• You used a program to optimize MTU for performance reasons, and now you are
experiencing connectivity or performance problems.
Note: An incorrect MTU setting can cause Internet communication
problems. For example, you might not be able to access certain
websites, frames within websites, secure login pages, or FTP or POP
servers.
 To change the MTU size:
1. Launch an Internet browser from a computer or wireless device that is connected to the

Optimize Video Streaming with Downstream QoS
Downstream Quality of Service (QoS) assigns a high priority to Internet video streaming from
websites like YouTube and Netflix.
Figure 8. Downstream QoS assigns a high priority to video streaming from the Internet
NETGEAR recommends that you enable downstream QoS only if you watch streaming
Internet video. When downstream QoS assigns a high priority to streaming video, it also
assigns a lower priority to the rest of your Internet traffic. That means other tasks like
downloading content from the Internet take longer.
 To enable downstream QoS:
1. Launch an Internet browser from a computer or wireless device that is connected to the
network.
2. Type http://www.routerlogin.net or http://www.routerlogin.com.

Improve Network Connections with Universal Plug and
Play
Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) helps devices such as Internet appliances and computers
access the network and connect to other devices as needed. UPnP devices can
automatically discover the services from other registered UPnP devices on the network.
If you use applications such as multiplayer gaming, peer-to-peer connections, or real-time
communications such as instant messaging or remote assistance (a feature in Windows XP),
enable UPnP.
Optimize Performance

By default, this check box is selected. UPnP for automatic device configuration can be
enabled or disabled. If the Turn UPnP On check box is cleared, the router does not allow
any device to automatically control router resources, such as port forwarding.
6. Type the advertisement period in minutes.
The advertisement period specifies how often the router broadcasts its UPnP information.
This value can range from 1 to 1440 minutes. The default period is 30 minutes. Shorter
durations ensure that control points receive current device status at the expense of more
network traffic. Longer durations can compromise the freshness of the device status, but
can significantly reduce network traffic.
7. Type the advertisement time to live in hops.
The time to live for the advertisement is measured in hops (steps) for each UPnP packet
sent. Hops are the steps a packet takes between routers. The number of hops can range
from 1 to 255. The default value for the advertisement time to live is 4 hops, which should
be fine for most home networks. If you notice that some devices are not being updated or
reached correctly, it might be necessary to increase this value.
8. Click the Apply button.
The UPnP Portmap Table displays the IP address of each UPnP device that is accessing
the router and which ports (internal and external) that device opened. The UPnP Portmap
Table also displays what type of port is open and whether that port is still active for each
IP address.
9. To refresh the information in the UPnP Portmap table, click the Refresh button.
Wi-Fi Multimedia Quality of Service
Wi-Fi Multimedia Quality of Service (WMM QoS) prioritizes wireless voice and video traffic
over the WiFi link. WMM QoS is automatically enabled for the router.
Optimize Performance
56

--- Page 57 ---
AC 1750Smart WiFi Router
WMM QoS prioritizes wireless data packets from different applications based on four access
categories: voice, video, best effort, and background. For an application to receive the
benefits of WMM QoS, WMM must be enabled in both it and the client running that
application. Legacy applications that do not support WMM and applications that do not
require QoS are assigned to the best effort category, which receives a lower priority than
voice and video.
 To disable WMM QoS:
1. Launch an Internet browser from a computer or wireless device that is connected to the
network.

Dynamic DNS
Internet service providers (ISPs) assign numbers called IP addresses to identify each
Internet account. Most ISPs use dynamically assigned IP addresses. This means that the IP
address can change at any time. You can use the IP address to access your network
remotely, but most people don’t know what their IP addresses are or when this number
changes.
To make it easier to connect, you can get a free account with a Dynamic DNS service that
lets you use a domain name to access your home network. To use this account, you must set
up the router to use Dynamic DNS. Then the router notifies the Dynamic DNS service
provider whenever its IP address changes. When you access your Dynamic DNS account,
the service finds the current IP address of your home network and automatically connects
you.
If your ISP assigns a private WAN IP address (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x), the Dynamic
DNS service does not work because private addresses are not routed on the Internet.
Your Personal FTP Server
With your customized free URL, you can use FTP to access your network through Dynamic
DNS when you aren’t home. To set up your FTP server, you must register for a free
NETGEAR Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service account and specify the account settings in the
router’s Dynamic DNS page.

Set Up a Default DMZ Server
The default DMZ server feature is helpful when you are using some online games and
videoconferencing applications that are incompatible with Network Address Translation
(NAT). The router is programmed to recognize some of these applications and to work
correctly with them, but other applications might not function well. In some cases, one local
computer can run the application correctly if the IP address for that computer is entered as
the default DMZ server.
WARNING:
DMZ servers pose a security risk. A computer designated as the
default DMZ server loses much of the protection of the firewall and
is exposed to exploits from the Internet. If compromised, the DMZ
server computer can be used to attack other computers on your
network.
The router usually detects and discards incoming traffic from the Internet that is not a
response to one of your local computers or a service that you configured in the Port
Forwarding/Port Triggering page. Instead of discarding this traffic, the router can forward the
traffic to one computer on your network. This computer is called the default DMZ server.
 To set up a default DMZ server:
1. Launch an Internet browser from a computer or wireless device that is connected to the
network.
2. Type http://www.routerlogin.net or http://www.routerlogin.com.

DHCP server. The router’s default LAN IP configuration is as follows:
• LAN IP address. 192.168.1.1
• Subnet mask. 255.255.255.0
These addresses are part of the designated private address range for use in private networks
and are suitable for most applications. If your network requires a different IP addressing
scheme, you can change these settings.
You might want to change these settings if you need a specific IP subnet that one or more
devices on the network uses, or if competing subnets use the same IP scheme.

How the Router Manages WiFi Clients
A WiFi client is any computer or WiFi device that connects to the router’s WiFi network. The
router uses airtime fairness and implicit beamforming to manage its wireless clients. These
features are enabled by default, but you can disable them.
Airtime Fairness
Airtime fairness ensures that all clients receive equal time on the network. Network resources
are divided by time, so if five clients connect to the router, they each get one-fifth of the
network time. The advantage of this feature is that your slowest clients don’t control network
responsiveness. This feature is enabled by default, but you can disable it.
 To disable Airtime fairness:
1. Launch an Internet browser from a computer or wireless device that is connected to the
network.
2. Type http://www.routerlogin.net or http://www.routerlogin.com.
A login window opens.
3. Enter the router user name and password.
The user name is admin. The default password is password. The user name and
password are case-sensitive.
The BASIC Home page displays.
4. Select ADVANCED > Advanced Setup > Wireless Settings.
The Wireless Settings page displays.
5. Scroll down below the WPS Settings section of the page and clear the Enable AIRTIME
FAIRNESS check box.
6. Click the Apply button.
Your settings are saved.
Implicit Beamforming
Implicit beamforming contrasts with explicit beamforming, which means that your router
actively tracks clients and directs power to the router antenna closest to the client. This works
whether or not the client supports beamforming. Implicit beamforming means that the router
can use information from client devices that support beamforming to improve the WiFi signal.
This feature is enabled by default, but you can disable it.
 To disable implicit beamforming:
1. Launch an Internet browser from a computer or wireless device that is connected to the
network.
2. Type http://www.routerlogin.net or http://www.routerlogin.com.

Control the Wireless Radios
The router’s internal wireless radios broadcast signals in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz range. By
default, the radios are on so that you can connect wirelessly to the router. When the wireless
radios are off, you can still use an Ethernet cable for a LAN connection to the router.
You can turn the wireless radios on and off with the WiFi On/Off button on the router, or you
can log in to the router and enable or disable the wireless radios. If you are close to the
router, it might be easier to press its WiFi On/Off button. If you are away from the router or
you already logged in, it might be easier to enable or disable the radios. You can also turn
them off and on based on a schedule. (See Set Up a Wireless Schedule on page 124.)

Set Up the Router with an Existing Router or Gateway
If you already use a router or gateway for your Internet connection, you can connect your
new router to your existing router or gateway and set up the router in one of the following
modes: router mode or access point (AP) mode.
Router mode lets you configure your new NETGEAR router as a normal WiFi router behind
your gateway and creates a separate WiFi network behind your gateway. To take full
advantage of this router’s advanced functions, NETGEAR recommends that you use router
mode. In router mode, the only device that can be connected to your existing gateway is your
new NETGEAR router. You must connect all of your devices to the new NETGEAR router. If
your existing gateway includes a WiFi function, disable it.
If you want to use the new router to get better WiFi performance than you get from your
existing gateway, access point mode is the easiest way to do that. NETGEAR recommends
that you disable the WiFi function on your existing gateway, if it uses WiFi functionality. With
this mode, you can connect wired devices to the gateway and connect wired and WiFi
devices to your new NETGEAR router.

Create Custom Static Routes
Typically, you do not need to add static routes unless your network includes multiple routers
or multiple IP subnets.
As an example of when a static route is needed, consider the following case:
• Your main Internet access is through a cable modem to an ISP.
• Your home network uses an ISDN router for connecting to the company where you are
employed. This router’s address on your LAN is 192.168.1.100.
• Your company’s network address is 134.177.0.0.
When you set up your router, two implicit static routes were created. A default route was
created with your ISP as the gateway, and a second static route was created to your local
network for all 192.168.1.x addresses. With this configuration, if you try to access a device on
the 134.177.0.0 network, your router forwards your request to the ISP. The ISP forwards your
request to the company where you are employed, and the company firewall is likely to deny
the request.
In this case you must define a static route, telling your router to access 134.177.0.0 through
the ISDN router at 192.168.1.100. Here is an example:

Set Up a VPN Connection
A virtual private network (VPN) lets you use the Internet to securely access your network
when you aren’t home.
Figure 13. VPN provides a secure tunnel between your home network and a remote computer
This type of VPN access is called a client-to-gateway tunnel. The computer is the client, and
the router is the gateway. To use the VPN feature, you must log in to the router and enable
VPN, and you must install and run VPN client software on the computer.
Note: The router currently does not support iOS and Android VPN client
software.
VPN uses DDNS or a static IP address to connect with your router.
To use a DDNS service, register for an account with a host name (sometimes called a
domain name). You use the host name to access your network. The router supports these
accounts: NETGEAR, No-IP, and Dyn.
If your Internet service provider (ISP) assigned a static WAN IP address (such as 50.196.x.x
or 10.x.x.x) that never changes to your Internet account, the VPN can use that IP address to
connect to your home network.

If you do not change the VPN interface name, the VPN tunnel connection will fail.
Use a VPN Tunnel
After you set up the router to use VPN and install the OpenVPN application on your
computer, you can open a VPN tunnel from your computer to your router over the Internet.
For the VPN tunnel to work, the local LAN IP address of the remote R6400 router must use a
different LAN IP scheme from that of the local LAN where your VPN client computer is
connected. If both networks use the same LAN IP scheme, when the VPN tunnel is
established, you cannot access your home router or your home network with the OpenVPN
software.
The default LAN IP address scheme for the R6400 router is 192.x.x.x. The most common IP
schemes are 192.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, and 10.x.x.x. If you experience a conflict, change the IP
scheme either for your home network or for the network with the client VPN computer. For
information about changing these settings, see Change the LAN TCP/IP Settings on
p age 110.

Use VPN to Access Your Internet Service at Home
When you’re away from home and you access the Internet, you usually use a local Internet
service provider. For example, at a coffee shop you might be given a code that lets you use
the coffee shop’s Internet service account to surf the web.
The router lets you use a VPN connection to access your own Internet service when you’re
away from home. You might want to do this if you travel to a geographic location that doesn’t
support all the Internet services that you use at home. For example, your Netflix account
might work at home, but not in a different country.

Application Example: Make a Local Web Server Public
If you host a web server on your local network, you can use port forwarding to allow web
requests from anyone on the Internet to reach your web server.
 To make a local web server public:
1. Assign your web server either a fixed IP address or a dynamic IP address using DHCP
address reservation.
In this example, your router always gives your web server an IP address of 192.168.1.33.
2. In the Port Forwarding/Port Triggering page, configure the router to forward the HTTP
service to the local address of your web server at 192.168.1.33.
HTTP (port 80) is the standard protocol for web servers.
3. (Optional) Register a host name with a Dynamic DNS service, and specify that name in the
Dynamic DNS page of the router.
Dynamic DNS makes it much easier to access a server from the Internet because you
can type the name in the Internet browser. Otherwise, you must know the IP address that
the ISP assigned, which typically changes.
How the Router Implements the Port Forwarding Rule
The following sequence shows the effects of a port forwarding rule:
1. When you type the URL www.example.com in your browser, the browser sends a web
page request message with the following destination information:
• Destination address. The IP address of www.example.com, which is the address of
your router.
Specify Internet Port Settings
162

--- Page 163 ---
AC 1750Smart WiFi Router
• Destination port number. 80, which is the standard port number for a web server
process.
2. Your router receives the message and finds your port forwarding rule for incoming port 80
traffic.
3. The router changes the destination in the message to IP address 192.168.1.123 and sends
the message to that computer.
4. Your web server at IP address 192.168.1.123 receives the request and sends a reply
message to your router.
5. Your router performs Network Address Translation (NAT) on the source IP address, and
sends the reply through the Internet to the computer or wireless device that sent the web
page request.
Set Up Port Triggering
Port triggering is a dynamic extension of port forwarding that is useful in these cases:
• An application must use port forwarding to more than one local computer (but not
simultaneously).
• An application must open incoming ports that are different from the outgoing port.
With port triggering, the router monitors traffic to the Internet from an outbound “trigger” port
that you specify. For outbound traffic from that port, the router saves the IP address of the
computer that sent the traffic. The router temporarily opens the incoming port or ports that
you specify in your rule, and forwards that incoming traffic to that destination.
Port forwarding creates a static mapping of a port number or range of ports to a single local
computer. Port triggering can dynamically open ports to any computer when needed and
close the ports when they are no longer needed.
Note: If you use applications such as multiplayer gaming, peer-to-peer
connections, real-time communications such as instant messaging, or
remote assistance (a feature in Windows XP), enable Universal Plug
and Play (UPnP). See Improve Network Connections with Universal
Plug and Play on page 55.

port triggering settings.
7. In the Port Triggering Timeout field, enter a value up to 9999 minutes.
This value controls how long the inbound ports stay open when the router detects no
activity. This value is required because the router cannot detect when the application
terminates.
Application Example: Port Triggering for Internet Relay Chat
Some application servers, such as FTP and IRC servers, send replies to multiple port
numbers. Using port triggering, you can tell the router to open more incoming ports when a
particular outgoing port starts a session.
An example is Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Your computer connects to an IRC server at
destination port 6667. The IRC server not only responds to your originating source port but
also sends an “identify” message to your computer on port 113. Using port triggering, you can
tell the router, “When you initiate a session with destination port 6667, you must also allow
incoming traffic on port 113 to reach the originating computer.” The following sequence
shows the effects of this port triggering rule:
1. You open an IRC client program to start a chat session on your computer.
Specify Internet Port Settings
165

--- Page 166 ---
AC 1750Smart WiFi Router
2. Your IRC client composes a request message to an IRC server using a destination port
number of 6667, the standard port number for an IRC server process. Your computer then
sends this request message to your router.
3. Your router creates an entry in its internal session table describing this communication
session between your computer and the IRC server. Your router stores the original
information, performs Network Address Translation (NAT) on the source address and port,
and sends this request message through the Internet to the IRC server.
4. Noting your port triggering rule and observing the destination port number of 6667, your
router creates another session entry to send any incoming port 113 traffic to your computer.
5. The IRC server sends a return message to your router using the NAT-assigned source port
(for example, port 33333) as the destination port and sends an “identify” message to your
router with destination port 113.
6. When your router receives the incoming message to destination port 33333, it checks its
session table to see if a session is active for port number 33333. Finding an active session,
the router restores the original address information replaced by NAT and sends this reply
message to your computer.
7. When your router receives the incoming message to destination port 113, it checks its
session table and finds an active session for port 113 associated with your computer. The
router replaces the message’s destination IP address with your computer’s IP address and
forwards the message to your computer.
8. When you finish your chat session, your router eventually senses a period of inactivity in the
communications. The router then removes the session information from its session table,
and incoming traffic is no longer accepted on port numbers 33333 or 113.

Quick Tips
This section describes tips for troubleshooting some common problems.
Sequence to Restart Your Network
When you must restart your network, follow this sequence:
1. Turn off and unplug the modem.
2. Turn off the router.
3. Plug in the modem and turn it on. Wait two minutes.
4. Turn on the router and wait two minutes.
Check Ethernet Cable Connections
If your device does not power on, make sure that the Ethernet cables are securely plugged
in.
The Internet LED on the router is lit if the Ethernet cable connecting the router and the
modem is plugged in securely and the modem and router are turned on.
If one or more powered-on computers are connected to the router by an Ethernet cable, the
corresponding numbered router LAN port LED lights.
Wireless Settings
Make sure that the wireless settings in the computer and router match exactly. The wireless
network name (SSID) and wireless security settings of the router and wireless computer must
match exactly.
If you set up an access list you must add each wireless computer’s MAC address to the
router’s access list.
Network Settings
Make sure that the network settings of the computer are correct. Wired and wirelessly
connected computers must use network (IP) addresses on the same network as the router.
The simplest way to do this is to configure each computer to obtain an IP address
automatically using DHCP.
Some cable modem service providers require you to use the MAC address of the computer
initially registered on the account. You can view the MAC address in the Attached Devices
page.

AC 1750Smar tWiFi Router
Troubleshoot with the LEDs
By default, the router is set with standard LED settings. If you disabled blinking for the LEDs
or turned off all LEDs except the Power LED, you must return the LEDs to their standard
settings for troubleshooting. For information about controlling the LED settings, see Disable
LED Blinking or Turn Off LEDs o n page 107.
Standard LED Behavior When the Router Is Powered On
After you turn on power to the router, verify that the following sequence of events occurs:
1. When power is first applied, verify that the Power LED is lit.
2. After approximately 2 minutes, verify the following:
• The Power LED is solid white.
• The Internet LED is lit.
• The WiFi LED is lit unless you turned off the wireless radio.
You can use the LEDs on the front panel of the router for troubleshooting.
Power LED Is Off or Blinking
Do the following:
• Make sure that the power adapter is securely connected to your router and securely
connected to a working power outlet.
• Check that you are using the power adapter that NETGEAR supplied for this product.
• If the Power LED blinks slowly and continuously, the router firmware is corrupted. This
can happen if a firmware upgrade is interrupted, or if the router detects a problem with the
firmware. If the error persists, this indicates a hardware problem. For recovery
instructions, or help with a hardware problem, contact technical support at
www.netgear.com/support.
Power LED Stays Amber
When the router is turned on, the Power LED lights amber for about 2 minutes and then turns
white. If the LED does not turn white, a problem occurred in the router.
If the Power LED is still amber one minute after you turn on power to the router, do the
following:
1. Turn off the power and then turn it back on to see if the router recovers.
2. Press and hold the Reset button to return the router to its factory settings.
See Troubleshoot Your Network Using the Ping Utility o n page 174.
If the error persists, a hardware problem might be the cause. Contact technical support at
www.netgear.com/support.
Troubleshooting
169

LEDs Never Turn Off
When the router is turned on, the LEDs light for about 10 seconds and then turn off. If all the
LEDs stay lit, this indicates a fault within the router.
If all LEDs are still lit one minute after power-up, do the following:
• Cycle the power to see if the router recovers.
• Press and hold the Reset button to return the router to its factory settings. For more
information, see Troubleshoot Your Network Using the Ping Utility o n page 174.
If the error persists, this might indicate a hardware problem. Contact technical support at
www.netgear.com/support.
Internet or Ethernet Port LEDs Are Off
If either the Ethernet port LEDs or the Internet LED does not light when the Ethernet
connection is made, check the following:
• Make sure that the Ethernet cable connections are secure at the router and at the modem
or computer.
• Make sure that power is turned on to the connected modem or computer.
• Be sure that you are using the correct cable.
When connecting the router’s Internet port to a cable or DSL modem, use the cable that
was supplied with the cable or DSL modem. This cable can be a standard
straight-through Ethernet cable or an Ethernet crossover cable.
WiFi LED Is Off
If the WiFi LED stays off, check to see if the WiFi On/Off button on the router was pressed.
This button turns the wireless radios in the router on and off. The WiFi LED is lit when at least
one wireless radio is turned on.
Cannot Log In to the Router
If you are unable to log in to the router from a computer on your local network, check the
following:
• If you are using an Ethernet-connected computer, check the Ethernet connection
between the computer and the router.
• Make sure that the IP address of your computer is on the same subnet as the router. If
you are using the recommended addressing scheme, your computer’s address is in the
range of 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254.
• If your computer’s IP address is shown as 169.254.x.x, this is becasue recent versions of
Windows and Mac OS generate and assign an IP address if the computer cannot reach a
DHCP server. These autogenerated addresses are in the range of 169.254.x.x. If your IP

address is in this range, check the connection from the computer to the router, and reboot
your computer.
• If your router’s IP address was changed and you do not know the current IP address,
clear the router’s configuration to factory defaults. This sets the router’s IP address to
192.168.1.1. For more information, see Factory Settings o n page 178.
• Make sure that Java, JavaScript, or ActiveX is enabled in your browser. If you are using
Internet Explorer, click the Refresh button to be sure that the Java applet is loaded.
• Try quitting the browser and launching it again.
• Make sure that you are using the correct login information. The user name is admin, and
the default password is password. Make sure that Caps Lock is off when you enter this
information.
• If you are attempting to set up your NETGEAR behind an existing router in your network,
use bridge mode or set up the router as an access point.
• If you are attempting to set up your NETGEAR router as a replacement for an ADSL
gateway in your network, the router cannot perform many gateway services. For
example, the router cannot convert ADSL or cable data into Ethernet networking
information. NETGEAR does not support such a configuration.
Cannot Access the Internet
If you can access your router but not the Internet, check to see if the router can obtain an IP
address from your Internet service provider (ISP). Unless your ISP provides a fixed IP
address, your router requests an IP address from the ISP. You can determine whether the
request was successful using the Router Status page.
 To check the WAN IP address:
1. Start your browser, and select an external site such as www.netgear.com.
2. Access the router interface at www.routerlogin.net.
3. Click the ADVANCED tab.
4. Check that an IP address is shown for the Internet port.
If 0.0.0.0 is shown, your router did not obtain an IP address from your ISP.
If your router cannot obtain an IP address from the ISP, you might need to force your cable or
DSL modem to recognize your new router by restarting your network. For more information,
see Sequence to Restart Your Network o n page 168.
If your router is still unable to obtain an IP address from the ISP, the problem might be one of
the following:
• Your Internet service provider (ISP) might require a login program.
Ask your ISP whether they require PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) or some other type of
login.
• If your ISP requires a login, the login name and password might be set incorrectly.
Troubleshooting
171

AC 1750Smart WiFi Router
• Your ISP might check for your computer’s host name.
Assign the computer host name of your ISP account as the account name in the Internet
Setup page.
• Your ISP allows only one Ethernet MAC address to connect to Internet and might check
for your computer’s MAC address. In this case, do one of the following:
- Inform your ISP that you bought a new network device, and ask them to use the
router’s MAC address.
- Configure your router to clone your computer’s MAC address.
If your router obtained an IP address, but your computer is does not load any web pages from
the Internet, it might be due to the following reasons:
• Your computer might not recognize any DNS server addresses.
A DNS server is a host on the Internet that translates Internet names (such as www
addresses) to numeric IP addresses. Typically, your ISP provides the addresses of one or
two DNS servers for your use. If you entered a DNS address during the router’s
configuration, reboot your computer, and verify the DNS address. You can configure your
computer manually with DNS addresses, as explained in your operating system
documentation.
• Your computer might not be set up with the router as router its TCP/IP gateway.
If your computer obtains its information from the router by DHCP, reboot the computer,
and verify the gateway address.
• You might be running login software that is no longer needed.
If your ISP provided a program to log you in to the Internet (such as WinPoET), you no
longer need to run that software after installing your router. You might need to go to
Internet Explorer and select Tools > Internet Options, click the Connections tab, and
select Never dial a connection. Other browsers provide similar options.
Troubleshoot PPPoE
If you are using PPPoE, try troubleshooting your Internet connection.
 To troubleshoot a PPPoE connection:
1. Launch an Internet browser from a computer or wireless device that is connected to the
network.
2. Type http://www.routerlogin.net or http://www.routerlogin.com.
A login window opens.
3. Enter the router user name and password.
The user name is admin. The default password is password. The user name and
password are case-sensitive.
The BASIC Home page displays.

AC 1750Smart WiFi Router
4. Click the ADVANCED tab.
The ADVANCED Home page displays.
5. In the Internet Port pane, click the Connection Status button.
The Connection Status window opens.
6. Check the Connection Status window to see if your PPPoE connection is up and working.
If the router is not connected, click the Connect button.
The router continues to attempt to connect indefinitely.
7. If you cannot connect after several minutes, the router might be set up with an incorrect
service name, user name, or password, or your ISP might be experiencing a provisioning
problem.
Unless you connect manually, the router does not authenticate using PPPoE until data is
transmitted to the network.
Troubleshoot Internet Browsing
If your router can obtain an IP address but your computer is unable to load any web pages
from the Internet, check the following:
• Your computer might not recognize any DNS server addresses. A DNS server is a host
on the Internet that translates Internet names (such as www addresses) to numeric IP
addresses.
Typically, your ISP provides the addresses of one or two DNS servers for your use. If you
entered a DNS address during the router’s configuration, restart your computer.
Alternatively, you can configure your computer manually with a DNS address, as
explained in the documentation for your computer.
• The router might not be configured as the default gateway in your computer.
Reboot the computer and verify that the router address (www.routerlogin.net) is listed by
your computer as the default gateway address.
• You might be running login software that is no longer needed. If your ISP provided a
program to log you in to the Internet (such as WinPoET), you no longer need to run that
software after installing your router. You might need to go to Internet Explorer and select
Tools > Internet Options, click the Connections tab, and select the Never dial a
connection. Other browsers provide similar options.
Changes Not Saved
If the router does not save the changes that you make in the router interface, do the
following:
• When entering configuration settings, always click the Apply button before moving to
another page or tab, or your changes are lost.

• Click the Refresh or Reload button in the web browser. It is possible that the changes
occurred, but the old settings might be in the web browser’s cache.
Wireless Connectivity
If you are experiencing trouble connecting wirelessly to the router, try to isolate the problem:
• Does the wireless device or computer that you are using find your wireless network?
If not, check the WiFi LED on the front of the router. If it is off, you can press the WiFi
On/Off button on the router to turn the router wireless radios back on.
If you disabled the router’s SSID broadcast, then your wireless network is hidden and
does not display in your wireless client’s scanning list. (By default, SSID broadcast is
enabled.)
• Does your wireless device support the security that you are using for your wireless
network (WPA or WPA2)?
• If you want to view the wireless settings for the router, use an Ethernet cable to connect a
computer to a LAN port on the router. Then log in to the router, and select BASIC >
Wireless.
Note: Be sure to click the Apply button if you change settings.
If your wireless device finds your network but the signal strength is weak, check these
conditions:
• Is your router too far from your computer or too close? Place your computer near the
router but at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away and see whether the signal strength improves.
• Are objects between the router and your computer blocking the wireless signal?
Troubleshoot Your Network Using the Ping Utility
Most network devices and routers contain a ping utility that sends an echo request packet to
the designated device. The device then responds with an echo reply. You can easily
troubleshoot a network using the ping utility in your computer or workstation.
Test the LAN Path to Your Router
You can ping the router from your computer to verify that the LAN path to your router is set up
correctly.
You can ping the router from your computer to verify that the LAN path to your router is set up
correctly.
 To ping the router from a Windows computer:
1. From the Windows toolbar, click Start and select Run.
Troubleshooting
174

--- Page 175 ---
AC 1750Smart WiFi Router
2. In the field provided, type ping followed by the IP address of the router, as in this example:
ping www.routerlogin.net
3. Click the OK button.
You see a message like this one:
Pinging <IP address > with 32 bytes of data
If the path is working, you see this message:
Reply from < IP address >: bytes=32 time=NN ms TTL=xxx
If the path is not working, you see this message:
Request timed out
If the path is not functioning correctly, one of the following problems might be present:
• Wrong physical connections
For a wired connection, make sure that the numbered LAN port LED is lit for the port to
which you are connected.
Check that the appropriate LEDs are lit for your network devices. If your router and
computer are connected to a separate Ethernet switch, make sure that the link LEDs are
lit for the switch ports that are connected to your computer and router.
• Wrong network configuration
Verify that the Ethernet card driver software and TCP/IP software are both installed and
configured on your computer.
Verify that the IP address for your router and your computer are correct and that the
addresses are on the same subnet.
Test the Path from Your Computer to a Remote Device
After verifying that the LAN path works correctly, test the path from your computer to a
remote device.
1. From the Windows toolbar, click the Start button and select Run.
2. In the Windows Run window, type
ping -n 10 <IP address>
where <IP address> is the IP address of a remote device such as your ISP DNS server.
If the path is functioning correctly, messages display that are similar to those shown in the
Test the LAN Path to Your Router o n page 174.
If you do not receive replies, check the following:
• Check that the IP address of your router is listed in your computer as the default gateway.
If DHCP assigns the IP configuration of your computers, this information is not visible in
Troubleshooting
175

your computer Network Control Panel. Verify that the IP address of the router is listed as
the default gateway.
• Check to see that the network address of your computer (the portion of the IP address
specified by the subnet mask) is different from the network address of the remote device.
• Check that your cable or DSL modem is connected and functioning.
• If your ISP assigned a host name to your computer, enter that host name as the account
name in the Internet Setup page.
• Your ISP might be rejecting the Ethernet MAC addresses of all but one of your
computers.
Many broadband ISPs restrict access by allowing traffic only from the MAC address of
your broadband modem. Some ISPs additionally restrict access to the MAC address of a
single computer connected to that modem. If your ISP does this, configure your router to
“clone” or “spoof” the MAC address from the authorized computer.
